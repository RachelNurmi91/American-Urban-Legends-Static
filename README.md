# AmericanUrbanLegends

Created a website with multiple landing pages using the Bootstrap library, custom CSS and HTML. The site is responsive on all browser sizes, including mobile devices. Select JavaScript elements have been added, including a nav bar that changes into toggler format on smaller screens and a clickable arrow that allows visitors to quickly go back to the top of the website once they have scrolled down.

### Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Visual Studio Code

### What I learned
During this project I learned how to customize bootstraps pre-set css classes. I was challened to make their genertic nav bar into one that fit the color scheme and design of the website. I also learned how to impliment a "to the top" button in order to bring viewers to the top of a long landing page. For this button I had to combind my prior CSS skills with JavaScript functions.
