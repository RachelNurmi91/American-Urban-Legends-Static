# AmericanUrbanLegends

Created a website with multiple landing pages using the Bootstrap library, custom CSS and HTML. The site is responsive on all browser sizes, including mobile devices. Select JavaScript elements have been added, including a nav bar that changes into toggler format on smaller screens and a clickable arrow that allows visitors to quickly go back to the top of the website once they have scrolled down.
